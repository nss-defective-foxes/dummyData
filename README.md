# API Readme

Created the JSON database to simulate an API. This entire directory could live in a different computer entirely and everything could still work properly provided that you run JSON server out of that directory.

To run:

1. cd into this directory
1. run the following command:

```bash
json-server -p 8088 -w nutshellDatabase.json
```
